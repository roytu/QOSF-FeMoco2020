Project for the QOSF mentorship program investigating the FeMo cofactor of nitrogenase

# Work Log

* (11/15/2020) Extracted ICS from [3U7Q](https://www.rcsb.org/3d-view/3U7Q/1) (see molecules/ICS.pdb)
    * This protein was found from [this paper](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/cp/c8cp06930a#!divAbstract) and was chosen for being from a high-resolution x-ray diffraction (1.0 A) experiment and contained the correct atom (carbon) in the central cage.
* (11/15/2020) Added ICS visualization from JMOL (see images/ics.png)
* (11/15/2020) Added initial script to generate the Hamiltonian (see `gen_hamiltonian.py`)
* (11/19/2020) Added results from initial attempt at evaluating the Hamiltonian (SCF Convergence Issue)
